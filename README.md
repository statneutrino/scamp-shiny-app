# scamp-shiny-appdata visualisation
A R Shiny app for public engagement showcase: a customisable data visualisation app to view anonymous questionnaire data about and view data visualisations in real time.

## Background
This repository has the code for R Shiny app that was used as part of a public engagement exhibition at the [Great Exhibition Road Festival](https://www.greatexhibitionroadfestival.co.uk/) in June 2022. 

As part of my PhD I collected data for and analysed data from the [Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP)](https://scampstudy.org/) is a prospective secondary school-based cohort study established to investigate 
whether use of mobile phones and other wireless devices are associated with cognitive, behavioural, educational, physical and mental health outcomes 
during adolescence. 

In 2022, we wanted to do a public engagement event, espeically with adolescents as our target audience, with the objectives:
- showcase the research process of epidemiology through simple statistical summary, descriptive, and inferential statistics through live data visualisation
- explain the objectives of SCAMP and describe hoew the public can be involved in research
- development of meaningful engagement activities that could be used again, e.g., in schools  
- promote conversation and awareness of phone and digital tech use and impact on mental and physical health
