## Mapping Screentime - Great Exhibition Road Festival 2023

This dashboard was created by [Alex Spiers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.spiers19), a researcher working with the [Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP)](https://scampstudy.org/) - a prospective secondary school-based cohort study established to investigate whether use of mobile phones and other wireless devices are associated with cognitive, behavioural, educational, physical and mental health outcomes during adolescence.

The dashboard was a part of a live exhibit at the [Great Exhibition Road Festival](https://www.greatexhibitionroadfestival.co.uk/) in June 2022. Members of the public were invited to share their smartphone-recorded metrics of screentime, and consented to anonymously share this data, along with their age and gender, using a questionnaire. The dashboard showed live data and was updated as often as the questionnaire was completed.

The aim of the dashboard was to:
- showcase the research processes behind observational studies on screentime and mental health through simple statistical summary, descriptive, and inferential statistics through live data visualisation
- explain the objectives of SCAMP and describe how the public can be involved in research
- development of meaningful engagement activities that could be used again, e.g., in schools  
- promote conversation and awareness of phone and digital tech use and impact on mental and physical health.
